                <h1>The Plaintiff's Story</h1>
                Kevin Brooks, a 19 year old high school student who was planning to graduate with honors, was subject to a false arrest and to an instance of police brutality. This is how it appears to any plain viewer when you look at the case simply. Brooks was a teenager who had a great future ahead of him, he was the model student who planned to graduate high school with high honors, and had been chosen “Best Lawyer” by the Tilden Street Law program, he had been on the path to become a lawyer and he had done all the right things. Even with doing everything right, he was still subject to an instance of police brutality, something we have seen to be more common than many americans thought, with the nation wide #BLM protests being evident of that. So Brooks is suing the officer who made the arrest and the metro city police department for “battery, false arrest, and intentional infliction of emotional distress'' after an incident with a Swiss Army Knife(Error it was with deoderant).”
                <br>
                <br>    
                The arrest occurred on March 15 2005, at a Shop All store. Brooks was arrested on the charge of Trespassing after refusing to leave the store, where he had originally gone to to return some items and  purchase some others before leaving on a flight to miami to attend his sister's wedding. He had been in the checkout line before closing time but left to get some more items, and when he went back he was told to leave without resolving his purchase, and that in turn led to an argument and a scuffle leading to his arrest.

                <br>
                Now let’s focus on his arrest since it is one of the most central parts of the case, dealing with the, “battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress”. He had been in the checkout line to get the items he needed for his flight, but he ran back because he forgot an incredibly important item: his deodorant. However when he ran back he was confronted by Mr. Lawrence the security guard at the shop, and in his own words, 
                “I tried to explain to Lawrence that my stuff was already at the register and that I just needed this one last important item, which I had forgotten and which the cashier knew I went back to get. Lawrence’s response was quite rude. Lawrence said, “I don’t care what the cashier said. I’m the security here, and you have to leave.” I needed the deodorant, and I was already in aisle one, so I was like, whatever. I just ignored him/her, grabbed a deodorant and walked to the register.” This doesn’t seem like a complex of a situation, Brooks simply wanted some deodorant and decided that he would run back and get it since the cashier said it was fine, even though the security guard was not. This situation would soon turn very dark, and I think a quote from officer Lawrence illustrates quite well his behavior in this situation, “I’ll fix you.”(Be aware that this statement was from Brooks’s witness testimony and not from Lawrence’s). When Brooks went to checkout Lawrence said he had to leave immediately, and in response Brooks yelled at him, “Look, the cashier knew I went back to get the deodorant. I don’t know what your problem is!” Lawrence started to escalate the situation, getting right into Brooks’s face and he said, “If you don’t leave, I am going to have to lock you up.” Let me remind you that up to this point Brooks had simply tried to checkout deodorant before closing time, which the cashier allowed, so he could go to his sister's wedding. You might argue that Lawrence was in the right however I believe we can all agree on one thing: he escalated the situation from something mundane and understandable, to a dangerous situation for a young man only 19 years of age. Brooks then pointed out the fact that he had done nothing wrong! He was starting to become frightened and sensed he was in danger, and according to Brooks so were the other shoppers! They tried to help but they were trapped outside because the door was closed. At that point he was incredibly afraid so he called 911 and asked the dispatcher to send police since he was scared the security guard might hurt him, and a few moments later the security moved to arrest him. Brooks says, “The security guard grabbed me, threw me on the conveyor belt, and tried to put handcuffs on me.” Brooks tried to get off the security belt however he was smashed on to the glass case as the security guard, Lawrence continued to try to arrest him. Brooks by his own admission was , “crying and yelling and just more upset than I can remember ever having been before.” When the cops finally arrived they put Brooks into the police wagon after Lawrence explained he had been arrested for trespassing and disorderly conduct. They wouldn’t listen to what Brooks had to say(REMINDER: this is all according to Brooks). His parents couldn’t help him since they were in Florida, and he still had to go to school and had an in school suspension. When his aunt went to the hospital with him the doctor told him his injuries, “sprained my left wrist and that there was a muscular strain to my right knee and left shoulder.”. When he met with the DA he was offered to do community service so he didn’t have to be tried. Brooks wanted to pursue the case to prove his innocence according to his witness statement however the hassle seemed too great.

                This seems to be a pretty clear cut case however we have only discussed one witness statement and there are still more facts to go over. This is the Fairness so we must dive deeper into this, to analyze even further, and to see if it is different then what it seems at first glance.
