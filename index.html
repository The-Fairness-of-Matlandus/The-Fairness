                <p>Witness tampering by the plantiffs?</p>
                <p>The doctor used by the plantiff prescribed him medication without the docotor even knowing it's effects!</p>
                <p>The plaintiff's team tries and fails to object to the admissibility of the evidence being showcased</p>
                <p>Did the plaintiffs witness break store policy? The defense is claiming they violated the stores rules. The plaintiffs witness admits wrong doing!</p>
                <p>Mr Lawrence says he was using necessary force as, "Mr Brooks was failing to comply"</p>
                <p>When Mr Lawrence attempted to escort her out she resisted and started fighting him</p>
                <p>The defence team is now presenting an exhibit, the security guards handbook! According to the handbook Lawrence was complying with the policy of no customers being allowed out of the line of the register or outside of the story. Even though the cashier told him it was okay she violated her own handbooks policy and Lawrence was complying with the correct course of action set out in the hand book</p>
                <p>This does not mean the use of force was necessary or if he approached the problem in the best way possible</p>
                <p>Is it possible that the current judge is biased against the former judge?</p>
                <p>According to Lawrence's testimony currently is that he didn't say "I'll fix you" but if he did it was justified, which is plainly ridiculous</p>
                <!-- I will have to compile this all later--> 
                <p>The store manager states they were the one to call the police on Brooks!</p>
                <p>The witness has now stated they had not in fact read the handbooks for either and did not know what the cashier did was wrong</p>

                <h1>The last day of the case!</h1>
                <p>Much has enfolded over the last few days, and if you want a general recap, check out the daily section where daily updates were posted on the happenings of the case.
                Now let us get to the day of the case.</p>
                
                <p>First off there is debate over whether the Lawrence acted as a police officer and whether he commited a false arrest based off of the fact he did not read him his Miranda rights.</p>
                <p>The defense represented by Ryan is arguing he detained him as a mall cop would and the arrest was on the part of the private company, and the plaintiff represented by Edrees has been arguing that he was acting as a police officer since he was an off duty cop, he arrested or detained him on charges only a cop could arrest on, and he gathered probable cause.</p>
                <p>The court is now going over the officers training, and they are going over the classes he took which he notably did well in, and right now Edrees said the direct examintion by Ryan asked a leading question and was an opinion since the witness, the chief of police was not recognised as an expert and is being recognised right now.</p>
                <p>Edrees and Ryan are arguing about the validty of the question and answer, currently it's just about the semantics since Ryan tried to prove a point with his question about occasional mistakes by officers.</p>
                <p>Now they are going over resisting false arrest, and when it is legal and illegal. <mark>This is very imporant since it looks like Edrees's legal strategy is to try to stay that the arrest was false given the lack of Miranda rights being told, and then to say resisting the arrest was legal since it was false, making almost everything Brown did okay and harder to attack.</mark> </p>
                <p>The court room arguments are heating up! There is currently a violent argument occuring continuing to adress whether the officer was acting as an officer, and whether trespassing actually occured.</p>
                <p>The defense and their witness do not appear to have an understanding of what you are allowed to do in cross examination, since they are trying to prove a point but do not know you are only allowed to answer the questions of the opposing council.</p>
                <h2>Closing argument time!</h2>
                <h3>The plaintiffs final argument</h3>
                <p>The plaintiffs closing argument, spoken by Edrees trys to sway the jury by asking them if the demand asked by Lawrence for Brook's to immediately leave was reasonable. He continues by saying the shop all has already accepted guilt for their employee commiting assault etc...however shop all probably didn't want a PR scandal to occur or to waste money in a court case.
                He then tells us the legal definition of trespassing and if his client, Brook's violated the law and was trespassing or if Lawrence’s arrest was baseless. He then cites common law from Metro City, "A person having or receiving a reasonable demand must leave, and that a reasonable demand includes a reasonable amount of time." Edrees is trying to argue that request was not reasonable and his client was not trespassing, making the arrest false, which falls in place with legal strategy of this being a false arrest, making Brook's reaction justified and legal! Now the lead of the plaintiff's legal team is attacking the defense's defenses and is now discussing Lawrences record with police brutality, and is citing what is police brutality, and is saying that the definition agrees with what happened during the arrest! He is now getting to emotional damages where Brook's had a public breakdown, and is now speaking of the sessions with his doctor and pyschologist after the indicident, and is now saying that the doctor misspoke in his messup a few days ago whilst on the witness stand. He is saying that Brook's reaction was justified and followed the law if it was a false arrest. He is finishing up his closing statement now and asks for the jury to observe the guilt of Lawrence and Metro City police dept. One notable thing from this is that he didn't really accuse Metro City of the crimes, which he probably should have done, however he might have run out of time.
                </p>
                <h3>The defenses last hoorah!</h3>
                <p>Ryan the lead of the defense team starts it off with complaining of the length opposing councils statement to bring some humour to the case. He is currently adressing the claims of false arrest and of the resisting of arrest. He is saying that the police department should not be charged, which is a good explotation of the fact that Edrees did not attack the police department's wrongdoings. He is now saying that Brook's preception of the happenings has been effected by the medicines and drugs he has taken after the incident. He is now calling for the court to think heavily on who is at fault here, and if the police department was even at fault. Ryan is now asking if the Brook's hurt himself as his reactions were extreme and dangerous</p>


                <h1>The Plaintiff's Story</h1>
                Kevin Brooks, a 19 year old high school student who was planning to graduate with honors, was subject to a false arrest and to an instance of police brutality. This is how it appears to any plain viewer when you look at the case simply. Brooks was a teenager who had a great future ahead of him, he was the model student who planned to graduate high school with high honors, and had been chosen “Best Lawyer” by the Tilden Street Law program, he had been on the path to become a lawyer and he had done all the right things. Even with doing everything right, he was still subject to an instance of police brutality, something we have seen to be more common than many americans thought, with the nation wide #BLM protests being evident of that. So Brooks is suing the officer who made the arrest and the metro city police department for “battery, false arrest, and intentional infliction of emotional distress'' after an incident with a Swiss Army Knife(Error it was with deoderant).”
                <br>
                <br>    
                The arrest occurred on March 15 2005, at a Shop All store. Brooks was arrested on the charge of Trespassing after refusing to leave the store, where he had originally gone to to return some items and  purchase some others before leaving on a flight to miami to attend his sister's wedding. He had been in the checkout line before closing time but left to get some more items, and when he went back he was told to leave without resolving his purchase, and that in turn led to an argument and a scuffle leading to his arrest. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Now let’s focus on his arrest since it is one of the most central parts of the case, dealing with the, “battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress”. He had been in the checkout line to get the items he needed for his flight, but he ran back because he forgot an incredibly important item: his deodorant. However when he ran back he was confronted by Mr. Lawrence the security guard at the shop, and in his own words, 
                “I tried to explain to Lawrence that my stuff was already at the register and that I just needed this one last important item, which I had forgotten and which the cashier knew I went back to get. Lawrence’s response was quite rude. Lawrence said, “I don’t care what the cashier said. I’m the security here, and you have to leave.” I needed the deodorant, and I was already in aisle one, so I was like, whatever. I just ignored him/her, grabbed a deodorant and walked to the register.” This doesn’t seem like a complex of a situation, Brooks simply wanted some deodorant and decided that he would run back and get it since the cashier said it was fine, even though the security guard was not. This situation would soon turn very dark, and I think a quote from officer Lawrence illustrates quite well his behavior in this situation, “I’ll fix you.”(Be aware that this statement was from Brooks’s witness testimony and not from Lawrence’s). When Brooks went to checkout Lawrence said he had to leave immediately, and in response Brooks yelled at him, “Look, the cashier knew I went back to get the deodorant. I don’t know what your problem is!” Lawrence started to escalate the situation, getting right into Brooks’s face and he said, “If you don’t leave, I am going to have to lock you up.” Let me remind you that up to this point Brooks had simply tried to checkout deodorant before closing time, which the cashier allowed, so he could go to his sister's wedding. You might argue that Lawrence was in the right however I believe we can all agree on one thing: he escalated the situation from something mundane and understandable, to a dangerous situation for a young man only 19 years of age. Brooks then pointed out the fact that he had done nothing wrong! He was starting to become frightened and sensed he was in danger, and according to Brooks so were the other shoppers! They tried to help but they were trapped outside because the door was closed. At that point he was incredibly afraid so he called 911 and asked the dispatcher to send police since he was scared the security guard might hurt him, and a few moments later the security moved to arrest him. Brooks says, “The security guard grabbed me, threw me on the conveyor belt, and tried to put handcuffs on me.” Brooks tried to get off the security belt however he was smashed on to the glass case as the security guard, Lawrence continued to try to arrest him. Brooks by his own admission was , “crying and yelling and just more upset than I can remember ever having been before.” When the cops finally arrived they put Brooks into the police wagon after Lawrence explained he had been arrested for trespassing and disorderly conduct. They wouldn’t listen to what Brooks had to say(REMINDER: this is all according to Brooks). His parents couldn’t help him since they were in Florida, and he still had to go to school and had an in school suspension. When his aunt went to the hospital with him the doctor told him his injuries, “sprained my left wrist and that there was a muscular strain to my right knee and left shoulder.”. When he met with the DA he was offered to do community service so he didn’t have to be tried. Brooks wanted to pursue the case to prove his innocence according to his witness statement however the hassle seemed too great.

                <br>
                This seems to be a pretty clear cut case however we have only discussed one witness statement and there are still more facts to go over. This is the Fairness so we must dive deeper into this, to analyze even further, and to see if it is different then what it seems at first glance.
